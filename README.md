Capstone Personal Project

For my personal project I created a new CSS theme for our group project. I also added a form to “Add a new project” using bootstrap. The form can be something we use moving forward in our group project. Since I was in charge of the backend for our group project I did not get to build any of the front-end. I used the personal project as an opportunity to brush up on HTML and CSS while also learning how to use bootstrap to implement quick features. I also made a few minor changes to the HTML. I changed some of the logo pictures, fixed the icon, edited some of the project descriptions to get rid of filler information, and fixed some of the padding issues. Since our project is based on the course, I added a GitHub logo/link until we can implement GitHub login. The link will take you to our GitHub Course Info Page. I also added an ASU link that takes you to the CIS department page where students can learn more about their major. This can also be used as one of our themes to test out on users and get feedback during our final demo.
